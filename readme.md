# Barbershop ##
#### a simple Photoshop `{{ templating }}` engine####

Defining Photoshop variables and importing data sets can be quite a tedious task. Other than that you're quite limited in what you can achieve with them and your files get messy because of all the separate textlayers for your variables. Barbershop aims to solve this.

Say you have to deliver good-looking website statistics reports every week ‹as I do›, and you're a little lazy ‹uhuh›, this is probably the right Photoshop script for you.

Just type `{{ variable }}` wherever you want inside your textlayers, import a csv or json'ish file and you're good to go. Run the script ([create a shortcut](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/photoshop/cs/using/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-7448a.html#WSA72EC22F-E602-4fa7-B236-401CCDD3DF1Aa) while you're at it) and start importing you're data.

## Simple install ##

copy `build/barbershop.jsx` to your photoshop scripts folder:

Windows: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS5\Presets\Scripts`   
Mac OS: `Applications\Adobe Photoshop CS5\Presets\Scripts`

If you have copied the .jsx file to the right directory, the script should appear in Photoshop under `file › scripts › barbershop` when you have restarted it.

## Usage ##

Create variables in the textlayers of your .psd by wrapping them in double curly brackets, like so: `{{variable}}`. You can use object notation here if you wish, so `{{object.object.key}}` will work too.

Run the script `file › scripts › barbershop` and a dialog should now appear where you can tweak some import settings.

Import your file and all your variables will be magically replaced by their matching data.

## Known issues ##
Make sure all content, other than a single word or number, is wrapped in "" (or whatever the string_delimiter setting is set to). You'll get an error saying something like `Delimiter expected after character x. (foo bar)` if you don't.
