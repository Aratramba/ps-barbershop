# Barbershop.js #
## Simple Photoshop `{{templating}}` engine ##

Import JSON / CSV data into your designs so you won't have to define them silly old Photoshop variables each and every time you want to import some dynamic data. Just type `{{ variable }}`, import a csv or json'ish file and you're good to go.


## Simple install ##

copy `build/barbershop.jsx` to your photoshop scripts folder.

Windows: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS5\Presets\Scripts` 

Mac OS: `Applications\Adobe Photoshop CS5\Presets\Scripts`

If you have copied the .jsx file to the right directory, the script should appear in Photoshop (restart) under `file › scripts › barbershop`

## Usage ##

Create variables in the textlayers of your .psd by wrapping them in double curly brackets, like so: `{{variable}}`. You can use JSON here if you wish, so `{{object.object.variable}}` will work too.

Run the script `file › scripts › barbershop` and a dialog should now appear where you can tweak some import settings.

Import your file and all your variables will be magically replaced by their matching variables.
